            The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth â€” about one million Earths could fit inside the sun. ... The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way.
